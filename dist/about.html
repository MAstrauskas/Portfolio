          <p>
            I am a 2nd-year Computer Science student at the University of
            Leicester, United Kingdom. I have knowledge in HTML/CSS, JavaScript,
            Java, Spring Boot, MySQL and Agile Scrum methodology. Since I am
            aspiring to become a professional Full Stack Developer, alongside my
            studies, I am also working on personal projects to showcase my
            skills and abilities. Furthermore, I am constantly building up my
            knowledge in Front End and Back End Development, currently focusing
            on React and Node.js.

            methodologies such as Test Driven Development, Agile Scrum and
            Refactoring. I have also learned basic data structures and
            algorithms and I am planning to expand my knowledge in these fields
            in my 3rd year.
